# React D3 Tree Map Visualization

For visualizing data, JavaScript provides a library called D3 or D3.js, which stands for Data Driven Documents. It is used for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser. D3 is built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.

In this project, I created a Tree Map using React and D3 with a dataset provided by FreeCodeCamp. This project visualizes data to create a Tree Map.

You can learn more about this topic by visiting the FreeCodeCamp website: [FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/).
